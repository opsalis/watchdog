# CLAUDE.md — Watchdog

## What is Watchdog
Decentralized Proof of Uptime — replace Pingdom/PagerDuty with 50-node multi-sig monitoring

This project runs ON the Opsalis network as an independent business.
It uses Opsalis the same way any API owner would — registers services,
earns USDC through the 95/5 settlement, runs in a Docker container.
No changes to Opsalis core code required.

## Revenue Model
- Service fees paid in USDC via Opsalis settlement
- 5% IP royalty to Opsalis on every transaction (immutable, on-chain)
- 95% goes to the service operator

## Tech Stack
